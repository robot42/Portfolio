          I work as a Product Owner since January 2022. Daily programming is no
          longer my focus. Instead, I spend my time with software architecture,
          discussions with stakeholders and my team and organising a lot of
          smaller tasks. And after one year I was wondering how much I already
          forgot from my old programming skills :-)
        </p>

          Some time ago I found a nice game named
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baba_Is_You">Babs is You</a>:
          simple, creative, retro, fascinating. A little side project seems be a
          good idea to test my programming skills and recreate the basics of the
          game. To make it challenging, I choose JavaScript and
          <a href="https://svelte.dev">Svelte</a> as programming languages. I
          had only a basic understanding of JavaScript (I could not tell the
          difference between &quot;==&quot; and &quot;===&quot;). And I knew
          nothing about Svelte at all except the name.

        <p>The development tools that I chose are:</p>
        <div class="small-spacer"></div>

        <ul>
          <li>Github Desktop</li>
          <li>Visual Studio Code</li>
          <li>JetBrains Rider</li>
          <li>Brave browser</li>
          <li><a href="https://jestjs.io">Jest</a> as test environment</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="small-spacer"></div>
        <p>
          The Svelte homepage provides a lot of examples. I downloaded one of
          them as a starting point. I also wanted to use TDD (test driven
          development) and installed jest. I spent about 2 hours to understand
          its philosophy and get comfortable with it. Jest is easy to integrate
          in a development process. It can watch my sources and run the tests
          automatically if changes were saved.

          I had a basic idea of the implementation in mind and started with the
          obvious: creating a game board and Baba, put him on the board, move
          him around and make sure that he does not fall off the edges.
          Everything in small iterations, tests first and then the
          implementation until all tests run successfully.
        </p>
        <div class="small-spacer"></div>
        <p>
          In the beginning, two major rewrites of the implementation where
          necessary. One because of my lack of knowledge about JavaScript and
          one because my initial design of internal data structures did not work
          out well. But I could do the rewrites without changing a large number
          of my tests.
        </p>
        <div class="small-spacer"></div>
        <p>
          The UI and Svelte came last. With a lot of help from the internet, I
          finally figured it out and created an interactive web app similar to
          the original game. My version allows Baba to move, get blocked by
          walls, push boxes around for fun and modify the environment.

            To used TDD, you need to understand and solve the problem first,
            then it can be implemented
          </li>
          <li>TDD reveals missing requirements early</li>
          <li>TDD creates good APIs</li>
          <li>
            TDD leads to good test coverage (over 90% in my case) but other
            testing is of course still necessary
          </li>
          <li>
            Have the logic implemented before you create the UI. The UI
            distracts me from writing tests
