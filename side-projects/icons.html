          Software for tool automation is not known for its style and beauty.
          But the tool operators and engineers have to use this software every
          day. The software should be easy to unterstand and icons can make it
          easier to recognize functions behind buttons without reading the label
          on the button.

          Unfortunately every developer has different style preferences and
          sources for icons. This leads to an inkonsistent set of icons. Let‘s
          have a look at the icons that we are using.

        <p>There are a few problems here.</p>
        <div class="small-spacer"></div>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Inconsistent weight - different line thickness is used. There are
            also wireframe icons and icons with filled forms.
          </li>
          <li>
            Inconsistent positioning - the icons are not always optically
            centered.
          </li>
          <li>Inconsistent style - a mix of flat and 3D icons.</li>
          <li>Duplications - icons have not been reused but instead added again.</li>
          <li>Confusion - some icons are difficult to understand.</li>
        </ul>
        <div class="small-spacer"></div>
        <p>
          Ok, let us create some ideas to fix these problems. What can we do
          here.
        </p>
        <div class="small-spacer"></div>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Define a style guide - The guide should contain basic rules to make
            sure that all icons look like they belong to the same set. But don't
            mak the guide too complicated and hard to follow. It will dicourge
            people from using ist.
          </li>
          <li>
            Use a grid to create icons - The lined in a grid make it easier to
            follow the style guide. All boxy shapes will have a similar width or
            height, all round shapes will have similar diameters.
          </li>
          <li>
            Create an inventory - Keep a list of all available icons and their
            possible usages. A seachable form like an online documentation is
            preferred. Users often have a specific word in mind when they look
            for an icon an can search in the document instead of reading
            everything and hope to find what they are looking for.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <div class="large-spacer"></div>
        <h2 class="decorated">The Process</h2>
        <div class="small-spacer"></div>
        <div class="separator"></div>
        <div class="small-spacer"></div>
        <p>
          After the initial analysis I created a list of all icons that the
          software currently has including the function or meaning. The final
          list contained 96 icons. But I knew already that I have duplictes and
          some icons xould be merged because they represented the same idea.
          Functions like "Add Recipe" and "Add Folder" had different icons but
          they can use the same. The number of icons went from 96 down to 64
          from the review.
        </p>
        <div class="small-spacer"></div>
        <p>
          In the next step I created a style guide and a grid for my new icons.
          There are a lot of helpful sources like Apple, Microsoft or Google. My
          style guide contains only a few points:
        </p>
        <div class="small-spacer"></div>
        <ul>
          <li>
            use only horizontal and vertical lines, 45° diagonals and circles
          </li>
          <li>Sharp corners</li>
          <li>1px lines</li>
          <li>only wireframe, no filled shapes</li>
          <li>single color</li>
          <li>leave a 2px border</li>
          <li>
            the overall shape of then icon (portrait, square, landscape) match
            the helper lines in the design grid
          </li>
        </ul>
        <div class="small-spacer"></div>
        <p>
          It is also helpful to illustrate the coordinates for diagonal line or
          the intersection of diagonal and horizontal or vertical lines because
          these do not fit the base grid of 1px.
        </p>
        <div class="small-spacer"></div>
        <p>
          Now I have a framework and I can begin to create all of the 64 icons
          that I need. Some of them like arrows, plus, minus, or cross will
          probably be very easy. Other, more abstract icons like initialize or
          automatic mode are difficult. But the the process is the same: create
          ideas, use Google to find inspirations, create my own sketches and
          then implement the final icon design.
        </p>

        <div class="large-spacer"></div>
        <h2 class="decorated">The Result</h2>
        <div class="small-spacer"></div>
        <div class="separator"></div>
        <div class="small-spacer"></div>
        <p>
          Here is an example of the final icon set. The icons look much better
          than before. All issues from the original version are addressed.
        </p>

    </section>

    <section class="dark-background">
      <div class="section-content side-project-image">
        <img src="icons_new.png" id="side_project_icons_new_img" class="rounded-image" alt="icons after rework"/>
      </div>
    </section>

    <section class="light-background">
      <div class="section-content">
        <p>There is still some room for improvements:</p>
        <div class="small-spacer"></div>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Some of the lines, especially the diagonals, look blurred. The
            reason is probably the line width of one pixel. Some repositioning
            might help, maybe the diagonal lines have to be a bit thicker than 1
            pixel.
          </li>
          <li>
            Some icons are still too complex and look busy. Especially the icons
            for keybard and table. Maybe they can be simplified in the next
            iteration.
          </li>
          <li>
            I did not always stick to my style guide. I used line angles of 30
            and 60 degrees in three icons. The next version of the style guide
            may include this exception.
          </li>
          <li>Is a floppy disk still the best option for a save button? :-)</li>
